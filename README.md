AI Engineer / Architect — Exploratory Research & Prototyping  
Principal Software Engineer (FinTech · React · FastAPI · AWS · TypeScript)

I’m working on exploratory research at the intersection of voice interaction, AI-assisted systems, and human-centered workflows — focusing on how AI can support everyday work, thinking, and decision-making.  
The work is research-driven: prototyping interaction patterns, testing workflow approaches, and identifying recurring patterns and anti-patterns in processes and system design.  
The goal at this stage is clarity, not a finished product.

## Architecture Overview

### Voice Interaction Layer

- Hybrid on-device + cloud processing for low latency and privacy.
- Speech-to-text pipelines designed to handle accents and noise.
- Voice-first UX patterns focused on clarity and low friction.

### Context & Memory Layer

- Captures recurring signals: routines, projects, people, and preferences.
- Supports long-running tasks with durable state and traceability.
- Privacy-first design with explicit consent for external data flows.

### Orchestration & Policy Layer

- Policies and safety rails for tool-use, escalation, and failure handling.
- Orchestrates intent → action pipelines via tools and APIs.
- Human-in-the-loop patterns where appropriate.

### Location & Environment Layer

- Optional location signals for context in tasks and routines.
- Time + place-aware policies for relevance and safety.
- Experiments with spatio-temporal patterns to support decisions.
