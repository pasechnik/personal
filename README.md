## Currently building — VoiceOS + GeoAI

VoiceOS + GeoAI — a persistent, privacy-first, voice- and location-aware layer between humans and devices that turns context into real-world actions.

- **VoiceOS:** always-available voice interface across phone, earbuds, car, and home.
- **GeoAI:** spatial understanding, geo-triggers, and behavior policies based on where you are and what you're doing.
- **Memory Graph / Personal Data Graph:** long-term memory of habits, people, places, and projects.
- **Behavior Engine:** rules, policies, and agents that decide what to do next on your behalf.
- **Contextual Agents:** LLM-orchestrated tools that can plan, reason, and act.
- **Secure Voice Payments & Biometric Voice Security:** frictionless auth and payments using voice as identity.
- **Privacy-first architecture:** on-device inference, encryption, and explicit consent for any external data flow.

This stack is the basis for a future **LifeOS** — an ambient, invisible UI that lets you live your life while the system handles orchestration.

## Vision — LifeOS & the human–device interaction layer

Modern assistants are either scripted or stateless. LLM agents are powerful but lack persistent context, memory, and real-world grounding.

- A unified **voice + context + location** fabric across devices.
- **Ambient computing / invisible UI:** less screen, more intention.
- Next-gen personal assistant that understands your **voice** (Whisper pipelines), knows your **context** (Memory Graph), understands your **world** (GeoAI), and can **act** (LLM orchestration, APIs, secure actions).

This is a platform for persistent, contextual, privacy-first assistants.

## Architecture Overview

### VoiceOS Layer

- On-device inference for low-latency, privacy-preserving interaction.
- Whisper pipelines for robust STT across accents and noise.
- Biometric voice security binding authentication and authorization to voice.
- Human–device interaction layer using voice as the primary interface.

### Memory Graph & Personal Data Graph

- Long-term signals: routines, habits, locations, people, projects, preferences.
- Models calendar, communication, commitments, tasks, financial events.
- Privacy-first architecture with local ownership of data.

### Behavior Engine

- Policies, safety rails, and contextual rules (time, location, identity, risk).
- Multi-agent orchestration for complex tasks with escalation when needed.
- Contextual agents for scheduling, travel, personal finance, home automation, and knowledge work.

### GeoAI Layer

- Geo-triggers and geo-fencing (leave home, arrive at work/gym/store).
- Location-aware behavior with policies for home, travel, work, driving, focus time.
- Spatio-temporal patterns that pre-emptively surface the right actions and information.
